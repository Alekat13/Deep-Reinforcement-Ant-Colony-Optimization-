# Deep Reinforcement Ant Colony Optimization
Swarm learning algorithm

Until recently, the astronomical number of possible states of the real environment limited the implementation of reinforcement machine learning algorithms only for simple tasks in a tabular grid world. Deep learning technologies have expanded the use of these algorithms for high-dimensional and complex virtual environments - computer video games. In addition, modern deep learning in general and multi-agent reinforcement learning in particular actively embededd classical machine learning algorithms to neural network architecture. Combining these trends, the paper proposes a new deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on the traditional ant colony optimization algorithm for solving the problem of cooperative homogeneous swarm learning. The algorithm forms the collective behavior of a decentralized multi-agent system consisting of a set of independent homogeneous agents that locally interact with each other and with the environment. The developed algorithm also presents an alternative stigmergic approach to the implementation of the leading multi-agent technology of centralized training with decentralized execution. Local and, often, random interactions in the process of centralized training lead to the emergence of collective behavior of a swarm, uncontrolled by individual agents in the process of real operation. An experimental study of the advantages of the developed algorithm was carried out in the virtual environment of [The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge](https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac).
