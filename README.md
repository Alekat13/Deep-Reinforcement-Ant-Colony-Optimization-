# Deep Reinforcement Ant Colony Optimization
Swarm learning algorithm

Until recently the implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms was limited by the astronomical number of the real environment possible states. Therefore these algorithms were implemented only for simple tasks in a tabular grid worlds. Deep learning technologies have expanded the use of these algorithms for multidimensional and complex virtual environments â€“ computer video games. Moreover, modern deep learning in general and multi-agent reinforcement learning in particular are actively porting classical machine learning algorithms to neural network architecture. Combining these trends, the new deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed based on the traditional ant colony optimization algorithm for solving the problem of cooperative homogeneous swarm learning. The algorithm shapes the collective behavior of a decentralized system, consisting of a set of independent homogeneous agents, locally interacting with each other and with the environment. The developed algorithm also represents an alternative stigmergic approach to the implementation of the leading multi-agent technology of centralized learning with decentralized execution. Local and often random interactions in the process of centralized learning lead to the emergence of agent swarm collective behavior, uncontrolled by individual agents in the process of real operation. An experimental study of the advantages of the developed algorithm was carried out in a virtual environment of [The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge](https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac).
